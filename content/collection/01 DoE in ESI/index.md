## Why need to optimize the ESI parameters?

ESI stands for .
We adjust the ESI parameters of a LC-MS/MS to optimize the sensitivity of analytes during the method development and validation stage.

There are many parameters, such as: gas temperature, gas flow, sheath gas temperature, sheath gas flow, capillary voltage, nozzle voltage, and nebulizer pressure. 


## How to optimize the ESI parameters?
two approaches:  
1) one parameter at a time.
2) Design of experiments approach

## Options of Design of Experiments software
